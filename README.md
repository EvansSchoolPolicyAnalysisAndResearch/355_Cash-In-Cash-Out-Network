https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/impact-regulations-cash-and-cash-out-networks.

These files include a coding spreadsheet and a CSV file used in the creation 
of the report. The CSV file was used specifically to create Figure 1 of the
report a time-line of when the low- and middle-income countries studied
implemented various categories of regulation. These categories include
"Know-Your-Customer," interoperability, and reporting regulations, among
others.

The spreadsheet contains this information as well as additional information 
about the regulations in each country. This includes descriptions of the 
regulations and what criteria were used to code the various regulations. In
aggregate this data was essential in measuring the impact of regulation on the
cash-in and cash-out networks and used to make comparisons across countries.
